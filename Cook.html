      <p class="cook_section_paragraph">  
        <span>I like making lots of desserts and cakes at home. One of my favorite things to make is Caramel Flan.</span>
        <span>For flan, I use 1 can of condensed milk, 6 eggs, 1 evaporated milk, and 1 cup of regular whole milk. I blend the ingredients together and set it aside to make the caramel sauce.</span>
        <span>The caramel sauce consists of 2 parts sugar and 1 teaspon of water. I cook it in a small saucepan and then transfer it to a oven safe tray.</span>
        <span>Once contents are in a oven safe tray I then transfer my blended flan mixture on top of the cooled caramel and place that tray in a bigger tray where I can steam the caramel flan with 1/2 cup of water in the oven.</span>
        <span>The caramel flan will need to bake in the oven for about 1.3 hours. Once it's done baking I place it in the freezer overnight and enjoy it the next day when it's cooled down to eat.</span>

      <p class="cook_section_paragraph">
        <span>My second top favorite dessert to make are brownies. I usually use boxed brownies mix but get a specific brand. I try to find the betty crocker brownie mix as its one of the most fudgey kind out there.</span>
        <span>I follow the recipe from behind the box and whisk dry and wet ingredients together, but ontop of that I also add a a cup of chocolate chips.</span>
        <span>That's my secret to getting really rich chocolatey brownies.</span>

    <img class="cook_img" src="https://www.asaucykitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Mango-Lassi-4.jpg" alt="Mango Lassi">
      <p class="cook_section_paragraph">
        <span>Third favorite item I like making is called Mango smoothie aka Mango Lassi.</span>
        <span>Mango Lassi is very easy to make you just need 4 ingredients.</span>
        <span>You will need 1 can of mango pulp or puree, 1/2 to 1 cup of sugar depending on personal preference, 2 cups of yogurt, ice, and 1 cup of whole milk.</span>
        <span>You blend all the ingredients together and pour all the contents in a glass cup with ice.</span>
        <span>Last, you can also add whipped cream on top of the lassi and a dash of sprinkles, but this step is optional.</span>
